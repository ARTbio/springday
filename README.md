# springday 2019
[Tutorial](https://artbio.github.io/springday/) for the Galaxy Spring Day training

## What ?
The aim of the training is to teach methods and best practices in using the Galaxy framework for intensive analyses of high throughput sequencing data

Attendees will work in a personal Galaxy account and perform a complete RNAseq analysis whose protocol can be seen [here](https://artbio.github.io/springday/), from sequence quality check to differential expression analysis and Gene Ontology term enrichments. The training will also cover visualisation of data in various genome browsers.

## Material
### Computers
We have 25 slots with computers that can run either Ubuntu or Windows to your convenience (no Macintosh). We have enrolled 29 participants because the room is large enough. Therefore, you are invited to bring your labtop if you have one, especially if you prefer to use MacOS X. The only requirements for your labtops are (i) a working web browser and (ii) a working wifi connection. Do not worry about the power (RAM, processors, storage) or the screen size of your labtop: we often use labtops and it works !

2 or 3 identical Galaxy servers will be deployed for exclusive usage of the attendees. These servers no be kept alive after the training day. However, canonical histories and workflows of the training will be made available to attendees in a public Galaxy server. The workflows will be also deposited in this GitHub repository.

### Internet connections

Computer in the training room have ethernet connection. Your labtops can connect internet either using `eduoram` or a SU wifi whose credentials will be provided individually the day of the training.

### Live Chat
A [Gitter chanel](https://gitter.im/ARTbio/springday)

    :alt: Chat on gitter

will be available to exchange information and results and raise questions or issues during the training. Please, take a few seconds to make sure that you have an easy access to the Gitter [springday](https://gitter.im/ARTbio/springday).

### Training material
All training material will be available in THIS repository, including slides, tutorial of the analysis, main results, etc...
Do not hesitate to register to GitHub. This is our core work platforme for Galaxy developments and you will be welcome to propose changes or share your own materials & documents in this repo, through Pull Request (we are considering to organize a GitHub training !).
