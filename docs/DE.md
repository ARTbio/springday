# Analysis of the differential gene expression

We will first investigate the differential gene expression to identify which genes are impacted by the Pasilla gene depletion.

### Count the number of reads per annotated gene

To compare the expression of single genes between different conditions (e.g. with or without PS depletion),
an essential first step is to quantify the number of reads per gene.

How many reads are found for the different exons?
