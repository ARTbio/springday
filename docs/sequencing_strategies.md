# Inserts and sequencing strategies

![](images/sequencing_strategies.png)

## in practice, with Illumina paired-end RNAseq protocols you will either deal with:

### Unstranded RNAseq data
**IU type from above. Also called fr-unstranded in TopHat/Cufflinks nomenclature**

### Stranded RNAseq data produced with Illumina TrueSeq RNAseq kits
**ISR type from above or fr-firststrand in TopHat/Cufflinks nomenclature**
