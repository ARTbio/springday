It is also mirrored at the EBI Small Read Archive under the accession number SRP001537 The data was generated through deep Sequencing of mRNA from the Drosophila melanogaster S2-DRSC cells that have been RNAi depleted of mRNAs encoding RNA binding proteins. In the tutorial, we are going to focus on 7 datasets generated to study the effect of the Pasilla gene inactivation by RNAi knock-down. 4 untreated samples: GSM461176, GSM461177, GSM461178, GSM461182 3 treated samples (Pasilla gene depleted by RNAi): GSM461179, GSM461180, GSM461181 Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment. Thus the following table will be (very) useful in our analysis since each of the 7 datasets are designated with (i) its original ID in GEO (or EBI SRA) (ii) its condition (untreated or treated) and (iii) the sequencing technology used (single read or paired-end).

Then you will have the possibility to import the full set of the 7 FASTQ files in one of your histories, from a data library that has been pre-set in your Galaxy server for this training session. Uploading data from your local computer Download the sample GSM461176/SRR031709 to your computer.
