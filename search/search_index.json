It is also mirrored at the EBI Small Read Archive under the accession number SRP001537 The data was generated through deep Sequencing of mRNA from the Drosophila melanogaster S2-DRSC cells that have been RNAi depleted of mRNAs encoding RNA binding proteins. In the tutorial, we are going to focus on 7 datasets generated to study the effect of the Pasilla gene inactivation by RNAi knock-down. 4 untreated samples: GSM461176, GSM461177, GSM461178, GSM461182 3 treated samples (Pasilla gene depleted by RNAi): GSM461179, GSM461180, GSM461181 Each sample constitutes a separate biological replicate of the corresponding condition (treated or untreated). Two of the treated and two of the untreated samples are from a paired-end sequencing assay, while the remaining samples are from a single-end sequencing experiment. Thus the following table will be (very) useful in our analysis since each of the 7 datasets are designated with (i) its original ID in GEO (or EBI SRA) (ii) its condition (untreated or treated) and (iii) the sequencing technology used (single read or paired-end). GSM461176_untreat_single - SRR031709_untreat_single GSM461177_untreat_paired - SRR031714_untreat_paired GSM461178_untreat_paired - SRR031716_untreat_paired GSM461179_treat_single - SRR031718_treat_single GSM461180_treat_paired - SRR031724_treat_paired GSM461181_treat_paired - SRR031726_treat_paired GSM461182_untreat_single - SRR031728_untreat_single Data upload We will take benefit of this mandatory stage, to review various possibilities to upload dataset in Galaxy. Then you will have the possibility to import the full set of the 7 FASTQ files in one of your histories, from a data library that has been pre-set in your Galaxy server for this training session. Uploading data from your local computer Download the sample GSM461176/SRR031709 to your computer. Upload this local file SRR031709.fastq.gz to your Galaxy history using the upload/Download Galaxy interface that pops up if you click the upload icone (put image). Importing data via links The sample GSM461177/SRR031714 was sequenced using paired-end sequencing. Thus, there are 2 files for forward and reverse reading of DNA fragment ends, respectively. GSM461177_1/SRR031714_1 (forward reads) can be downloaded from the link ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR031/SRR031714/SRR031714_1.fastq.gz GSM461177_2/SRR031714_2 (reverse reads) can be downloaded from the link ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR031/SRR031714/SRR031714_2.fastq.gz However, do not download these files on your local machine. Instead, copy the links ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR031/SRR031714/SRR031714_1.fastq.gz ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR031/SRR031714/SRR031714_2.fastq.gz and paste them in the Paste/Fetch data tab of the Galaxy upload interface. In addition, select fastqsanger.gz in the Type menu. Press the start button. Importing data via the EBI SRA ENA SRA The sample GSM461178/SRR031716 is also a paired-end sequencing. This time, we are going to download the two corresponding fastq.gz files directly from the EBI SRA using the tool EBI SRA ENA SRA in the Get data tool submenu. 1. Click on this tool (you can select it rapidly using the search bar) 2. In the search box of the EBI SRA website, enter `SRR031716` 3. Two categories of results are retrieved, Experiment and Run. What we want to get are the files from the sequencing runs. Thus, click the SRR031716 link in the Run section (1 results found). 4. Click on \"File 1\" in the `FASTQ files (Galaxy)` Column. You will be switched back to the Galaxy interface, and the download of the SRR031716_1.fastq.gz file will start immediately as a yellow dataset in the history right panel. Without waiting for the complete download of SRR031716_1.fastq.gz, you can repeat the previous steps 1, 2, 3 and 4. Just Click on `File 2` instead of `File 1` in step 4 Importing data from data libraries For collaborative work, Galaxy offers data libraries, where datasets can be stored and available to one or multiple users. This is what we are going to use to import rapidly all the input data you need for this RNAseq analysis. All datasets have been preloaded in the data library named RNAseq . To access this library and import its content in your histories: Click the menu Donn\u00e9es partag\u00e9es ( Shared data ) and select the submenu Biblioth\u00e8que de Donn\u00e9es ( Data libraries ). Navigate to the data library RNAseq Select all datasets Click the To History button and select as Datasets In the pop up window, or create new and type Input data to transfer the datasets in a new history with this name. Click on the green box to navigate to this new history (or click on the main menu analyse data ) and start using these datasets.","title":"Data upload"},{"location":"uploads/#data","text":"The original data is available at NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE18508 .
